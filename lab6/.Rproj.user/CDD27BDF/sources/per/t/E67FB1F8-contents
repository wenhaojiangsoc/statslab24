## Part 1: Multivariate Regression & Interaction with One Dummy

### Part 1 Exercise (from Lab 5)

  1. Import `lab5_earnings.csv` to your environment. Perform the following data cleaning steps: 
    (1) If `age` takes the value 9999, recode it as `NA`; 
    (2) Create a new variable `female` that equals 1 when `sex` takes the value `female`, and equals to 0 otherwise; 
    (3) Create a new variable `black` that equals 1 when `race` is `black` and equals to 0 otherwise; 
    (4) Create a new variable `other` that equals to 1 when `race` is 'other` and 0 otherwise.
  
  2. Use the `describe()` function from the `psych` package to generate a quick descriptive statistics of your data.
  
  3. Now, estimate the following models and display your model results in a single table using `stargazer(m_1, m_2, ..., m_n, type="text")`. 

(1) Model 1: earn ~ age (baseline)
(2) Model 2: earn ~ age + edu 
(3) Model 3: earn ~ age + edu + female
(4) Model 4: earn ~ age + edu + female + race
(5) Model 5: earn ~ age + edu + female + race + edu*female

  4. Write down your prediction equation for Model 5

  5. In Model 5, holding other variables constant, what will be the predicted difference in estimated mean earnings for a white man and a white women?  
  
  6. Holding other variables constant, what will be the predicted difference in estimated mean earnings for a white women and a black women?  
  
  7. Holding other variables constant, what will be the predicted difference in estimated mean earnings for a white man and a black women?

```{r }

# Import
earnings_df <- read.csv("data/lab5_earnings.csv", stringsAsFactors = F)

# Recode age & sex
earnings_df <- earnings_df %>%
  mutate(age_recode = ifelse(age == 9999, NA, age),
         female = ifelse(sex == "female", 1, 0))

# Recode race
earnings_df <- earnings_df %>% 
  mutate(black = ifelse(race == "black", 1, 0),
         other = ifelse(race == "other", 1, 0))

# Display
head(earnings_df, 10) %>% kbl("html") %>% kable_classic_2(full_width = F)

# Describe
describe(earnings_df)

# Nested Models

m1 <- lm(earn ~ age_recode, 
         data = earnings_df)

m2 <- lm(earn ~ age_recode + edu,
         data = earnings_df)

m3 <- lm(earn ~ age_recode + edu + female,
         data = earnings_df)

m4 <- lm(earn ~ age_recode + edu + female + black + other,
         data = earnings_df)

m5 <- lm(earn ~ age_recode + edu + female + black + other + edu*female,
         data = earnings_df)

# save(m5, file = "data/m5_fordemo.RData") #save for demo purpose

stargazer(m1, m2, m3, m4, m5, type="text", omit.stat=c("f"))


```

Q4: Equation according to model 5 (coefficients are simplified for demostration purpose):

$$\hat Y = 17 + 0.2 \cdot \text{Age} + 6 \cdot \text{Edu} - 2\cdot\text{Female} -2 \cdot \text{Black} -1 \cdot \text{Other} - 3\cdot\text{Edu*Female}$$

Q5: In Model 5, holding other variables constant, what will be the predicted difference in estimated mean earnings for a white man and a white women?
    
- "White man" is the reference category, so its group mean is the intercept  
- "White woman" will make the terms $(- 2\cdot\text{Female})$ and $(- 3\cdot\text{Edu*Female})$ non-zero
- The difference in means will be $-2-3\cdot\text{Edu}$
  
Q6: Holding other variables constant, what will be the predicted difference in estimated mean earnings for a white women and a black women? 

- "White woman" will make the terms $(- 2\cdot\text{Female})$ and $(- 3\cdot\text{Edu*Female})$ non-zero
- "Black woman" will make the term $(- 2\cdot\text{Female})$, $(-2 \cdot \text{Black})$, and $(-3\cdot\text{Edu*Female})$ non-zero
- The difference in means will be $-2$
  
Q7: Holding other variables constant, what will be the predicted difference in estimated mean earnings for a white man and a black women?

- "White man" is the reference category
- "Black woman" will make the term $(- 2\cdot\text{Female})$, $(-2 \cdot \text{Black})$, and $(3\cdot\text{Edu*Female})$ non-zero
- The difference in means will be $(- 2 -2 + 3\cdot\text{Edu}) = (-4 + 3\cdot\text{Edu})$

### Part 2 Exercise 

  1. What will be the predicted difference in estimated mean earnings for a white person with a college degree and a black person with a college degree? Whose earnings will be higher?
  
  2. What will be the predicted difference in estimated mean earnings for a white person with a college degree and a black person without a college degree? Whose earnings will be higher?
  
  3. What will be the predicted difference in estimated mean earnings for a white person without a college degree and a black person without a college degree? Whose earnings will be higher?
  
  4. What will be the predicted difference in estimated mean earnings for a white person without a college degree and a black person with a college degree? Whose earnings will be higher?
  
  5. What will be the predicted difference in estimated mean earnings for a white person with a college degree and a white person without a college degree? Whose earnings will be higher?
    
  6. What will be the predicted difference in estimated mean earnings for a black person with a college degree and a black person without a college degree? Whose earnings will be higher?
  
  7. How to interpret the interaction coefficient? 


**Answer**  
  Q1: -(-2.773 + 1.496)  = 1.277, white with college will be 1.277 higher than black with college  
  
  Q2: 6.129 - (-2.773) = 8.902, white with college will be 8.902 higher than black without college  
  
  Q3: 2.773, white without college will be 2.773 higher than black without college    
  
  Q4: -(-2.773 + 6.129 + 1.496) = -4.852, white without college will be 4.852 lower than black with college  
  
  Q5: 6.129, white with college will be 6.129 higher than white without college
  
  Q6: 6.129 + 1.496 = 7.625, black with college will be 7.625 higher than black without college
  
  Q7: There are two ways to interpret the interaction coefficient: (1) For black respondents, having a college degree will provide an additional positive effect on one's earning. (2) For respondents with a college degree, being black will provide an additional positive effect on one's earning.

To solve these questions, you can write down the prediction equation of this model:

$$\hat {Earning} = 15.077 -2.773 \cdot \text{black} + 6.129 \cdot \text{college} + 1.496 \cdot \text{black} \cdot \text{college}$$  
Then, specify the prediction equations for four possible respondents and compare them accordingly.

1. A white person with a college degree:
$$\hat {Earning} = 15.077 -2.773 \cdot 0 + 6.129 \cdot 1 + 1.496 \cdot 0 \cdot 1$$
2. A black person with a college degree:
$$\hat {Earning} = 15.077 -2.773 \cdot 1 + 6.129 \cdot 1 + 1.496 \cdot 1 \cdot 1$$

3. A white person without a college degree:
$$\hat {Earning} = 15.077 -2.773 \cdot 0 + 6.129 \cdot 0 + 1.496 \cdot 0 \cdot 0$$

4. A black person without a college degree:
$$\hat {Earning} = 15.077 -2.773 \cdot 1 + 6.129 \cdot 0 + 1.496 \cdot 1 \cdot 0$$
