# Confounding variables can cause significant problems for social science researchers. In this example, if we did not have data on temperature, we might assume that the number of people swimming explains most of the variation in ice cream sold. In reality temperature explains both. To guard against confounding variables, we ought to rely on previous research, theory, and, in this case, common sense. 

# Question: in all cases, our R-squared is 1 since there is such a high degree of correlation. How might we simulate data that like this that does not have such a high degree of correlation and thus R-squared?
