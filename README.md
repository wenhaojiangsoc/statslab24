# Introduction to Statistics, Graduate Level
Lab materials for SOC-GA 2332 Intro to Stats (Fall 2024, NYU Sociology) \
Office Hours: Tuesday 2PM-4PM [here if meet on Zoom](https://nyu.zoom.us/my/wenhaojiang)
 

### Prerequisite
+ Please download & install R: https://cloud.r-project.org/
+ Please download & install Rstudio: https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/. If you have installed R and Rstudio before, please update it to the latest version.

### Lab 1 Basic of R and Rstudio, R Markdown (9/6/2024)
+ Lab 1 covers the introduction R and to Rstudio, RMarkdown, data structures in R, basic data cleaning, and a guidance to assignment 1.
+ Download the lab or assignment folder from the link: https://download-directory.github.io/. You will need to **copy and paste the link of the folder after you click the target folder**. For example, lab 1 link is: https://github.com/wenhaojiangsoc/statslab24/tree/main/lab1

### Lab 2 Visualization and Sampling Simulation (9/13/2024)
+ Lab 2 covers basic visualizations in `R` using the standard package `ggplot2`. We will use the package to simulate the sampling process and visualize some properties for the sampling distribution.

### Problem Set 1 (Due 9/30/2024)
+ Please knit `ps1_problems.Rmd` in the `ps1` folder to convert the problem set to either a PDF or html file. Please submit a PDF file if you can, and only submit a html file if PDF is not possible. Please pay attention to the instructions of the assignment.

### Lab 3 Hypothesis Testing, Two Sample Means, and Overleaf (9/20/2024)
+ Lab 3 covers the `R` implementation of hypothesis testing, the comparison of two sample means, and an introduction to Overleaf.
+ An Overleaf template for your final project and for your future use as a baseline can be found [here](https://www.overleaf.com/8539929553qtggbbwwpbvq). **Please do not edit it**; instead, select it and copy it to **your own archive** for your future use.

### Lab 4 Bivariate OLS Regression, Download Data from IPUMS (9/27/2024)
+ Lab 4 covers the `R` implementation of basic bivariate OLS regression and an introduction to IPUMS and data extraction.

### Problem Set 2 (Due 10/25/2024)
+ Please knit `ps2_problems.Rmd` in the `ps2` folder to convert the problem set to either a PDF or html file.
+ Please feel free to raise questions in lab or in my office hours.

### Lab 5 Simulation of OLS Regression with Interaction Terms (10/04/2024)
+ Lab 5 covers simulations of OLS regression, with one and multiple predictors, using `R`. We will also cover interaction terms and how to interpret them.

### Lab 6 OLS Anatomy, Confounding, Interactions with Dummies (10/11/2024)
+ Lab 6 covers the exogeneity assumption in OLS, its relation with confounding, and interactions with dummy variables.

### Lab 7 Types of Multivariate Relationships, Hetero/Homoskedasticity, Replication Project (10/18/2024)
+ Lab 7 covers the four types of multivariate relationships, the violation of homoskedasticity, robust standard error, and the replication project

### Lab 8 Dummy Variables, Predicted Outcomes (10/25/2024)
+ Lab 8 covers dummy variables and their interactions, and the visualization of predicted outcomes from regression.

### Lab 9 Causal Inference Framework (11/01/2024)
+ Lab 8 covers the causal inference framework.
